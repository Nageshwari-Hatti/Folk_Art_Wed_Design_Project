        52 Incredible Heritage of Indian Folk Art that We Must Protect and Preserve for the Next Generation
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        The Indian culture is rich and diverse with many beautiful things to see. But the best part about India is the
        folk
        art. India has a rich tradition of folk art which has been passed down through generations.

        Indian folk art has always been an important part of the culture. It’s not just an artist’s expression but also
        a
        way to portray their stories, memories, values and beliefs.

        Along with all the amazing things that India has to offer, it also has its own set of problems. The problem that
        affects Indian Folk Art most is that people are losing interest in it because they don’t see much value in it
        anymore.

        Indian folk art is made up mostly of two distinct forms: applied and decorative arts. Applied arts refer to the
        crafts that are created with a specific function and decorative arts refer to those that are made for display
        purposes. Both types have played a vital role in India’s economy and culture since ancient times.

        Here are my top 52 Indian folk arts that we all must appreciate and try to revive.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            Aipan art originated from Almora in Uttarakhand, which was founded during the reign of the Chand dynasty. It
            flourished during the reign of the Chand dynasty in the Kumaon region.

            The Chand dynasty was a Hindu Rajput dynasty that ruled much of the northern Indian subcontinent around the
            10th
            century.

            The art form has many regional variations. It’s origins are in the North Indian state of Uttarakhand. Aipan
            art is
            an ancient style of painting depicting mostly Jain, Hindu and Buddhist themes. The designs and motifs in
            Aipan Art
            are motivated by the beliefs of the community and various aspects from nature.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Some people believe that writing on empty walls with a reddish paint brings about good fortune. Others
            believe that
            this is just an aesthetic custom which has no meaning, but it’s still pretty cool.

            The creation of rice flour art has deep cultural and religious significance in Kumaon. It is often found on
            the
            floor and walls of Puja rooms, as well as at entrances to homes. This form of artisanry is mostly practiced
            by women
            from this region.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            Assam has a rich history of its tradition, art and culture and it flourished in the 16th century. The Bhakti
            movement spread in medieval times, thanks to Sankaradeva’s work (1449-1569) and helped create a culture of
            lively
            paintings.

            Assamese Miniature painting is a technique in which art is painted on a small surface. The size of the
            painting
            varies from 1 inch to 24 inches in height and 8 inches to 12 inches in width. It is often made on ivory,
            wood, metal
            or paper

            Assamese manuscript paintings may be grouped under the following categories. 1. Sattriya or Sankari style,
            2.
            Gadgayan or Royal Style 3. Darrangi or Folk Style 4. Tai Style.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The process of making an Assamese miniature starts withdrawing outlines for the composition on paper. The
            outlines
            are then filled with color using water-based paints or gouache. The final step involves inserting miniscule
            details
            to the entire painting after it has dried up completely.

            It is said that the latex of Kendu tree duck’s eggs or tamarind seeds were used as adhesive with all the
            colours.
            But the fruit of Wood Apple was used as the best adhesive. The proportion that you should mix the adhesive
            to colour
            is illustrated.

            The Bhil Tribe are native to western and central India. Today, there are fifty of them, which makes them the
            third
            largest community in India. The Bhil tribe once used to be mainly hunters back in time and they were skilled
            archers
            too.

            They have long taken to agriculture and some have migrated to large cities taking up masonry, road making
            and other
            manual labour.

            Art is integral to the Bhil community. Song, dance and painting, accented with feasting and drinking is used
            to mark
            events, store memories and fight despair and disease. Steeped in rituals, symbolism and tradition, the rich
            textures
            of their paintings connect them to nature and the Adivasi life that is their legacy.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Bhil paintings are a form of folk art, an art produced by the common people or folk artists from Bhil
            community. It
            is believed to be the oldest surviving form of Indian painting and has been practiced for over two
            millennia.

            The Bhils are a large tribal community residing in central India (Madhya Pradesh). They can trace their
            ancestry to
            Eklavya and Valmiki, who, they say, was actually from their community.

            Distinctive Dots: Stories, prayers, memories and traditions are painted onto plain backgrounds in a symphony
            of
            multihued dots. The first step to learning the art for many Bhil artists began with mastering the dots.

            One of the most popular forms of art in Uttar Pradesh, Bhojpuri Painting has played a major role in the
            development
            and sustenance of art culture. Dating back to 1300 BC, it is even older than King Ashoka himself!

            It’s difficult to gauge the exact origin of this art form. Certain facts from the past make us believe that
            these
            paintings surfaced during the reign of King Ashoka. Bihar is always being under the major hotspot for
            education,
            culture, and power.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Bihar is the 9th largest state in India. It is a historical and ancient land. The Bihar region was
            historically
            known as Magadha, one of the 16 Mahajanapadas of ancient India. Many great Buddhist scholars and monasteries
            lived
            in this land.

            Bihar is a state with a rich heritage of culture and knowledge. It has been an education hotspot for many
            centuries

            The Cheriyal Scrolls paintings are made in Hyderabad. They are made by ragi dough that is shaped into
            scrolls and
            then hand painted with vegetable colors. The scrolls depict scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata or other
            epic folk
            stories.

            The traditional art form was inseparable from the job of the story-telling, balladeer community known as
            Kaki
            Padagollu.

            The scroll would go up to 40-45 feet long. It would usually be about 3 ft wide and written in vertical
            format.
            Traditional scrolls are set horizontally, meaning it shows the story spread across the page.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            These canvas scrolls made from Khadi are hand-painted in a style unique to the local motifs and iconography.
            Characterised by a dominance of the colour red in the background, these brilliantly hued paintings even
            received
            Geographical Indication Status in 2007.

            Painted in panels as a narrative, these are like comic strips from the past, depicting scenes and stories
            from
            Indian mythology and epics. Distinct in their style they immediately convey age-old Indian traditions and
            customs in
            a beautiful and engaging manner.

            Chittara Art is an autochthonous art practice. It is a ubiquitous cultural phenomenon of the Deevaru
            community, a
            matriarchal and an agrarian community of nature worshipers, residing in an around Sagar.

            It is engaged primarily by the Women folk of the community as a socio-cultural practice, which embodies a
            microcosm
            of socio-cultural dynamic.

            Nestled in the ranges of verdant western ghats of North Canara lives Deevaru community. Chittara drawings
            are
            intricate patterns, that represent the auspicious ceremony and rituals of life, symbolized in geometric
            patterns.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            This requires a certain understanding of ratios and proportions, which the women of the community have been
            using
            with great dexterity. This folk art was and still is a part of their day-to-day life. It was never a
            profession, but
            a practice that has artistic and socio-cultural value.

            The paintings are usually 2 – 3 feet in size, aesthetically refined, made of symbols representing their
            physical
            environment. They use eco-friendly natural resources like ground rice paste for white colour, roasted rice
            for
            black, yellow seeds (Gurige) red earth and the brushes are made up of Pundi Naaru.

            Term “Chitrakathi” comes from two words: “chitra” meaning picture and “katha” meaning story. A
            Chitrakathi is
            someone who tells stories, with a visual aid. Tribal life has a long-standing tradition of such
            storytellers.
            Chitrakathi is an occupational caste whose traditional livelihood was to narrate stories aided with
            pictures
            sojourning various places.

            Chitrakathi is a combination of two words from the Sanskrit language: chitra meaning picture and katha
            meaning
            story. With this app, a Chitrakathi is the one who narrates stories with a visual aid. There’s a
            long-standing
            tradition of this in tribal life<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            This art form, called Chitrakathi, is practiced within the Thakar tribe in Maharashtra. They are
            wandering musicians
            who perform the traditional stories at different villages.

            They would make a series of single sheets of paintings. All paintings belonging to one story were kept
            in a bundle
            called a ‘pothi’. Painting themes include local versions of Ramayana and Mahabharata as well as
            mythological
            stories.

            Dokra Art, Dokra Damar tribes are the main traditional metalsmiths in West Bengal and Odisha, whose
            technique of lost wax
            casting is named after them.

            Dokra Art (also called Dhokra) named after Dhokras tribe, a nomadic group that extends from Jharkhand to
            the
            southern state of West Bengal and the eastern state of Odisha. They can be traced back to a few hundred
            years ago
            when they traveled extensively, going as far as Kerala and Rajasthan.

            Dokra (also spelt Dokra) is non–ferrous metal casting using the lost-wax casting technique. This sort of
            metal
            casting has been used in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the earliest known lost
            wax artefacts
            is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro.

            There are two main processes of lost wax casting: solid casting and hollow casting. While the former is
            predominant
            in the south of India the latter is more common in Central and Eastern India.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Solid casting is one of the most common techniques in creating an impression mould and only requires a
            solid piece
            of wax.

            To create an intricate, high-quality Dokra Art sculpture, the artist creates a model in clay. This is
            coated with
            wax so it can be cast in metal. The lost-wax process of wax casting involves two phases: solid casting
            and hollow
            casting.

            A Kolam is a geometrical line drawing made up of straight lines, curves and loops, constructed around a
            dot grid
            pattern. Kolams are generally considered auspicious symbols and are believed to bring prosperity to
            homes.

            The kolam is made by drawing concentric circles around a central dot. The number of circles that are
            drawn denotes
            the number of evil spirits that can be eliminated from the premises. Kolams are generally drawn on clean
            floors with
            rice flour, jaggery, or chalk powder.

            Kolams are typically drawn when the surface is still damp so that the design will hold onto it better.
            Instead of
            rice flour, occasionally white stone powder is used to create kolams. They also use cow dung to wax down
            their
            floors during these occasions.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            In the olden days, the lines were drawn using a
            coarse rice
            flour that ants could eat without having to walk too far or too long. The rice powder also invites birds
            and other
            small creatures to eat it, thus welcoming other beings into one’s home and everyday life: a daily
            tribute to stark
            co-existence.

            Indian homes, welcome Lakshmi and the prosperity and wealth she brings. Decorative patterns range from
            very
            geometric designs that use repeating shapes around a square of dots to more fluid artwork that fills the
            entire
            space.

            Godna Art or Tattooing has been a part of Indian culture for a very long time. It is popular in tribal
            societies as
            well as those in the North & Central regions. In Northern and Central India it is called “Godna”
            tattooing which was
            observed as being typical of primitive tribes groups.

            Godna art is the term used to describe permanent ornamentation of the body with tattoos. It is mostly
            practiced in
            Chhattisgarh state of India.  Gonda, like other forms of tattooing, needs artistic
            dexterity and
            precision.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The main purpose of tattooing one’s body is to obtain acceptance from society. Sometimes tattoos are
            also done on
            areas of the body that are not readily visible. The art itself provides an ideal canvas for originality
            and
            self-expression, which is what everyone wants.

            Godna art is
            deeply rooted
            in their spirituality and belief. They believe ornaments are mortal and human made like humans
            themselves.

            Tattoos are commonly used as permanent body decorations and often emblematic of a certain group or
            identification.
            The tribal women of Chhattisgarh, India decorate their bodies with tattoos called “Godna.”

            Some tribal people have traditional tattoos. Tribal beliefs say that it’s often the only decoration that
            remains
            with a person after death.

            Gond painting has been practiced by the Gond tribe of Madhya Pradesh, India. Generally painted with dots
            and dashes
            or short lines, their illustrations feature complex patterns.

            A type of Mural painting, done beautifully on the walls and floors as part of festival celebrations.
            Primarily using
            natural pigments for colors from vegetables, flowers, cow dung or mud etc

            Gondi culture is the main background for the designs and patterns selected. Gondi is an Indian tribe
            that lives in
            the regions of Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and Andhra Pradesh. The unique feature of Gond painting is the
            fusion of
            living creatures with nature, they all seem connected.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The story of Gond painting is not complete without mentioning young Gond Tribal Artist Jangrah Singh
            Shyam, who
            transformed these mural paintings to canvas and paper in 1981 and tragically passed away in Japan under
            mysterious
            circumstances at the age of 39, promoting Gond Art in Japan.

            His style of Gond painting on paper and canvas is also widely known as Jangarh Kalam. Gond tribal artist
            Jangrah
            Singh Shyam, is a master of the Gond tradition. He creates contemporary art with natural materials such
            as bamboo
            and leaves.

            The Jadopatia painting of Jharkhand is a type of folk art that has been practiced in the Indian
            state of Jharkhand
            for centuries. The paintings are made with natural pigments on cloth, metal, wood, or leaves.

            These are generally practiced by the Santhals, where artisans make scrolls called Jado or Jadopatia
            which are drawn
            with natural inks and colours. They are used to help people tell stories in the form of
            illustrations. They depict
            scenes from the faraway afterlife, beliefs in tiger Gods etc.

            The Jadupatua paintings are vertical scroll paintings that were performed on cloth in earlier days
            but later these
            paintings were done on papers.

            The scrolls of traditional horizontal scrolls were made into vertical scrolls and the length of the
            painting was
            then reduced to allow more than one scene to be shown. The use of color is very subdued and mainly
            limited to earth
            tones such as brown, yellow, and orange<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Most ancient scrolls were made from waste paper. 
            The scrolls were made up of sheets of paper that were either glued or sewn together and often
            wrapped in fabric so
            as to protect the scroll’s contents.

            The scroll was secured with a string at each end. Pieces of bamboo were sewn in to act as rollers,
            so the scroll
            could be wound tightly around them.

            Some scrolls were short and had two or three panels, while others could have 14 or more.

            Kalamezhuthu is a traditional art form that originated in Kerala. The art form uses the patterns of
            rice flour paste
            and water colours on a cloth to create elaborate paintings. The whole process of Kalamezhuthu is
            done by using the
            hands only and it cannot be erased or reused, which makes it an exclusive and exquisite art form.

            ‘Kalamezhuthu’ is a type of medieval Hindu art that was popular in the south of India from around
            1750-1850. The
            word means ‘drawing pictures’, and pictures of gods and goddesses became the central theme.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            A lot of religious art is done in the form of ritualistic drawings – for example, pictures of gods
            created by using
            coloured powders. It is believed that such depictions are there to ‘welcome’ gods.

            The art form is accompanied by a long chant sung before the performance starts. It’s done on the
            floor, which is
            what gives it its meaning in this context. The artform sees all of Earth as one large canvas to
            paint on.

            Kalamkari use natural colors from materials such as charcoal, turmeric, leaves and rice. White is
            derived from rice,
            black from charcoal, yellow from turmeric and green from leaves. Red can be made by mixing other
            colors.

            During November & December, you can see Kalamezhuthu performances at many different Devi temples in
            Kerala.

            The term “Kalamkari” is said to have come from two Tamil words, “Kalam”, which means pen, and
            “Kari”, which means
            craftmanship. Kalamkari Painting became popular under the patronage of the Golconda sultanate.

            Kalamkari is the Oriental word for the Indian village of Kalamkari where this type of hand-painted
            or block-printed
            textile was originally produced. Now, Kalamkari paintings are also made in Isfahan (Iran), Andhra
            (India) and
            Telangana (India).

            Only natural dyes are used in Kalamkari, which involves 23 steps. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            There are two distinctive styles of Kalamkari art
            in India – the Srikalahasti style and the Machilipatnam style.

            To create Kalamkari, the cloth is first steeped in a mix of buffalo milk and astringents. This is
            then dried under
            sunlight. Afterwards, the colors for red, black, brown and purple are outlined with a mordant before
            being placed on
            the cloth.

            To dye a blue part of a cloth the next step is to cover other parts in wax and then immerse it in
            indigo dye. After
            the cloth is out of the indigo, scrape off the parts covered by wax and paint on any other areas
            needed. This is similar to Indonesian batik

            To create contours for a design, artists use a pen which they created by attaching fine hair to the
            pointed end of
            bamboo or date palm.

            The Kalighat paintings are a tradition of religious art prevalent in West Bengal, India. The
            paintings of the Hindu
            goddess of the same name, Kali, are painted on cloth and can be seen on roadside stalls and shops.
            These paintings
            depict various scenes from Hindu mythology and people believe that they bring good luck and
            prosperity.

            The Kalighat paintings originated from being items people would buy when they visited the Kalighat
            Kali Temple in
            West Bengal, India. The paintings have been around since the 19th century and have developed a lot
            over time.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The Kalighat paintings started off with illustrations of Hindu gods & deities, but quickly
            diversified to show a
            variety of topics from everyday life. In the 19th century, traditional scroll paintings were
            flourishing in Bengal.
            These paintings were popular in rural areas and were the only form of art that could compete with
            European styles.

            These paintings were done on this kind of material. They usually depict the gods and goddesses as
            well as scenes
            from epics like Tulsidas’ Rama Charita Manas. The artists depicted medieval epics on scrolls and
            travelled around
            singing the stories to listeners. They were called patuas.

            The Kangra paintings are an art form of Kangra, India. It is said that the craft was born in the
            17th century and it
            has been passed down from generation to generation. It is still practiced today at various places in
            and around
            Kangra Valley.

            One of the most famous styles of Indian art, Basohli, died out in 18th century. However since then
            many paintings
            have been created in this style that helped it become more popular than the Pahari art.

            This style reached its peak during the reign of Maharaja Sansar Chand Katoch (r.1776–1824) who was a
            huge supporter
            of Kangra art. The paintings he commissioned where large in size and fueled the work for others
            providing them with
            more commissions.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Maharaja Sansar Chand was an ardent devotee of Krishna and often commissioned artists to paint
            scenes from Krishna’s
            life. The main subject in Kangra paintings is Shringar (an romantic sentiment).

            Kangra painting is most well-known for its graceful lines, bright colours and detailed décor- it
            follows a style
            similar to that of Ajanta.

            This style of painting used a fine type of brush that was made from squirrel hair. In addition to
            using pure colors
            to paint the Kangra region, the colors have retained their vibrancy over time.

            “The enjoyment of stories has been around since the dawn of civilization. We love listening to new
            stories, old
            stories, and especially ones about gods who punish the wicked.”

            There are plenty of storytellers in the world and one form that stands out is a mobile storyteller,
            who carries
            beautiful stories in a colorful house-like structure. This is the kavad.

            The Kavad is a portable wood-carved shrine that is traditionally used to house and worship Hindu
            gods and goddesses.
            They are usually beautifully carved and painted panels in a traditional style.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            The Kavad has been the prized
            possession of the Suthar community in Mewar for over 500 years, with several families claiming to be
            its
            originators.

            Suthars are typically made from wood cut from the Neem tree and traditionally red was used as the
            color. However,
            over time this has changed to match customer demand.

            The word Kavad probably comes from the word “Kivaadh” which means door. It can after-all be seen as
            a collection of
            doors or doors that open the layers of a story.

            Kerala Mural Paintings are one of the most well known and distinctive forms of art from Kerala,
            India.

            The Kerala mural paintings are a form of temple art that have been practiced in Kerala for over 2000
            years and has
            been preserved through generations by local artists. Although they have been influenced by western
            techniques, they
            have retained their Indian roots.

            They have a close connection to the daily life of the people, and express the religious and cultural
            traditions of
            Kerala. The art form can be seen in religious & cultural traditions of Kerala, and depicts scenes
            from the
            traditional Puranas as well as daily life of local people.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Kerala’s own style of murals has been seen in the Thirunadhikkara Cave Temple and Tiruvanchikulam.
            These murals have
            been dated to around 400 A.D.

            A mural is a large painting on a wall that often depicts a story. The word is the Latin word for the
            word ‘wall’,
            which correlates with them being painted on either side of a wall.

            Traditional murals are painted with five colors, which are red, yellow, green, black and white.
            These all
            traditionally come from natural substances that the painter has on hand. Red, yellow and white
            paints were
            traditionally made from two sources: red laterite and white lime. Black paints were the result of
            oil-lamp soot
            deposits.

            Rajasthani paintings are divided into different schools, one of which is the Kishangarh School of
            Art. Kishangarh
            Painting is a style of Indian painting that originated in the city of Kishangarh, India.

            The school has a distinct appearance with a religious atmosphere. The facades of the buildings were
            aggressive and
            distracted from the sublime, while because of their delicate form, they responded to female heads
            with strong facial
            features that were drawn in a very different way from previous generations.

            Artists of Kishangarh created beautiful, intricate miniatures under the rule of Maharaja Savant
            Singh, the
            18th-century Rajput king. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            He was a devotee of Krishna and this influenced his rule. Therefore, most paintings were
            based on the romantic stories of Krishna and Radha.

            The Radha Krishna in these paintings were, in fact, used to represent Maharaja Savant Singh and his
            mistress and
            later his wife, Vishnupriya. The paintings are titled “Radha Krishan” because they depict the story
            of their love.

            As the wife of Maharaja Savant Singh, Vishnupriya adorned herself with exquisite makeup to represent
            her royal
            stature.

            Bani Thani, which is a Mughal miniature painting, has been speculated to be the influence behind
            Kishangarh facial
            types.

            Kondapalli Toys are made from wood and are from the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

            Wooden painted toys from Kondapalli are famous for their finely crafted figures of animals and
            people. The wood is
            locally sourced and adds a touch of aesthetics to rooms with their spindly figures. These toys have
            carved out a
            niche of their own in the world of handicrafts.

            Artisans with nimble fingers carve wooden characters with aplomb, as the characters emerge from
            light soft wood. The
            wooden piece is heated to make it moisture-free. For each part of the carving, a different carved
            design is made.
            The sections are then glued using an adhesive obtained by crushing tamarind seeds.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The traditional craft of crafting remains popular and is an important way for many people to earn a
            living.
            Craftspeople, known as Aryakhastriyas, who form the ‘Nakarshalu’ family and weave these yokes were
            mentioned in
            Brahmanda Purana, which was compiled over 400 years ago.

            The artisans are said to have migrated from Rajasthan in the 16th century to Kondapalli and claims
            their origin to
            Muktharishi, a sage endowed with skills in arts and crafts by Lord Shiva.

            Water colours and oil pastels are the two different types of materials typically used to paint toys
            or figurines.

            Kurumba painting (Tamil Nadu): Kurumbas are one of the five communities which occupy various
            altitudinal zones of
            the Nilgiri ranges, the Kurumbas are believed to be the descendants of the Pallavas.

            These Indigenous tribes are known for their healing power, hunting skills and knowledge of medicinal
            plants.

            In subject, the Kurumba art style is quite similar to the Warli and Saura folk painting styles. The
            key difference
            between these three is in their style. Whereas both Warli and Saura depict elaborate figures, a
            Kurumba artwork has

            The Kurumba painting is characterized by its concentric arrangement of colours. It features more
            than three colours

            The figures in the paintings seem to be dancing even though they are most likely performing
            different tasks.
            Consider the level of detail in how they are drawn.

            The figures featured in the painting are recognized by their bunned hair. One group is known as the
            Warli and the
            other, Saura. These two groups have two bodies but these figures only feature one almost rectangular
            shaped body.”

            Unlike the other folk art of Warli and Saura, animals are not often seen in Kurumba paintings. This
            is quite
            different than these other two forms of folk art which contain a lot animal imagery.

            The Kutch Lippan Art is a form of art that originated from the Kutch region in Gujarat. This form of
            art is a result
            of a fusion of the traditional Kutch crafts with British and Indian techniques.

            Lippan art is a traditional craft native to Gujarat. The mud and mirror work features materials such
            as clay and the
            dung of the local camel population, which allows for an interesting effect that keeps homes cool.

            Though they’re originally from Kutch, these scintillating murals can be found on the outer walls as
            well. You can
            notice these murals on both exterior and interior walls. They provide a type of beauty to a
            generally harsh way of
            life in the region.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Women from the Rabari community are typically in charge of mud and mirror work. They don’t trace or
            draw a pattern
            before beginning the work. This has made them especially skilled at this art form.

            Rabari is the pastoral community from Kutch who live in villages. They live in houses called Bhungas
            which are
            designed to accommodate their practical needs.

            This art form has a hoary past as no records are available to trace its origin. Various communities
            in Kutch do
            mud-washing in their own distinct style.

            A common practice in Kutch, India is the art of mud-washing. Mud-washing is an ancient form of folk
            art practiced by
            various communities around the world.

            Andhra Pradesh is famous for its traditional leather puppet art and craft. The leather puppets found
            in this state
            hail from the traditional folk and cultural expression of the region, known as Leather puppetry.

            A traditional form of shadow puppet theatre practised in Andhra Pradesh, it is known as tollubommalu
            or
            tollubommalatta. The name is derived from the Telugu word for leather, tollu and dolls or figurines,
            bommalu.

            Places like Nimmalakunta in Ananthapur district, Narsaraopet in Guntur district and D.C. Palle in
            Nellore district
            are considered the main centers of leather puppet industry in Andhra Pradesh.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            The variety of people who participate in this form of craft is
            mostly the
            Marathi-Balija culture.

            Creating a shadow puppet traditionally takes around 30-40 days. The amount of time required will
            vary depending on
            the complexity of the puppet.

            The first step of this process is to buy fresh goat hide from the weekly meat market. Next, it
            should be soaked in
            cold water for 2-3 hours before it can be cut and flattened with a heavy object like a hammer. To
            create leather,
            the animal’s skin is washed in warm water and dried in the sun. Once it is dry, it must be cut
            according to product
            requirements.

            Mandala is a Sanskrit word that can translate to “circle” or “discoid object.” These geometric
            designs have deep
            symbolic meaning in Hindu & Buddhist cultures.

            Mandalas are representations of various aspects of our universe which are used as instruments of
            meditation. They
            are also symbols of prayer, most notably in the East Asian countries, China, Japan and Tibet

            Around 560 BC, Gautama became increasingly aware of human suffering and left his kingdom in order to
            attain
            enlightenment through meditation and thoughtful action.

            Buddha preached his philosophy across parts of India and established the first sangha, a Buddhist
            community of
            monks. <br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            According to legend, Buddha began preaching his philosophy across parts of India, where he
            attracted
            followers and eventually established the first Buddhist community of monks.

            We first learn about mandalas through the travels of Buddhist monks who shared practical, moral
            pursuits with
            others. Through them, it spread to other Asian regions including Tibet, China, and Japan by the 4th
            century.

            The use of mandalas in Buddhist, Hindu, and various other religions is documented. Some painters of
            the spiritual
            craft were pious individuals who were commissioned for their work by a patron. They worked seated on
            the floor with
            a painting propped on their lap or in front of their crossed legs.

            Mandana Painting is a type of tribal art that has become popular in recent years. It has been around
            for centuries
            and used by traditional Meenas people.

            Respect to writing records, the origin of Mandana paintings can be traced back to the Vedic age,
            1500 to 500 BCE.
            Resembles with the design found in Mandana art and its relationship with color & symmetry are
            well-known. The lack
            of recorded evidence is replaced by theories that state Mandana paintings’ origin can be seen in its
            similarities to
            other recordings.

            Vastu purasha mandalas are altars of Vedic pujas and the architecture of ancient Vedic temples.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            The core beliefs of
            drawing mandala paintings and art on the walls and floors are to welcome divinity into the house and
            keep away from
            evil forces.

            “Mandana” translates to “drawing” in the language of Gujjar Bhakha and may also be derived from
            “Mandan”, which
            means “decorate.”

            The making of Mandana paintings is a unique process, which marks the beginning with clay and cow
            dung. Traditions
            and cultures are then integrated into a simplistic painting that is both attractive and
            eye-catching.

            The brushes used for this artwork are made from a combination of twigs, cotton & squirrel hair.
            Local paint colors
            consist solely of red & white, which is what makes them unique. Their source is chalk or brick that
            can be found in
            abundance in the region.

            Madhubani painting, also known as Mithila painting is a traditional Indian folk art that uses
            geometric patterns,
            contrasting colors & line drawings.

            The painting dates back to the time of Raja Janak, a king in a Mithila. He had a daughter named Sita
            who was married
            to Lord Ram. To celebrate her wedding, Raja Janak asked his subjects to decorate their city in
            beautiful ways.

            In the recent years, artists have been painting murals with geometric patterns on walls all around
            the city. They
            depict some rituals of weddings, births and celebrations.

            Historically, Madhubani painting was passed down from generation to generation in the family of
            Mithila Region. The
            five distinctive styles are Bharni, Kachni, Tantrik, Godna and Kohbar.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Madhubani paintings are always two-dimensional and come with no empty spaces, usually filled with
            drawings of
            flowers, animals, birds, and other geometric designs.

            These paintings are traditionally produced on freshly plastered wall surfaces or floors of huts, but
            now they are
            also created on cloth, handmade paper or canvas. The paste required to make them usually contains
            powdered rice.

            This painting is created with a variety of tools and naturally-made dyes. It features colourful
            geometric patterns
            which are pretty eye catching, so it’s easy for anyone to see.

            ‘Mata Ni Pachedi’ literally means ‘behind the mother goddess’ and was worn as a draping that
            constituted the temple
            of worship for her. These textiles are sacred and act as a backdrop for daily rituals.

            Mata ni Pachedi is also called the Kalamkari of Gujarat because of its resemblance to the Kalamkari
            art of South
            India, which is also done with a pen made of bamboo.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The story goes that when the nomadic Vaghari community from Gujarat, who worship Mata, were not
            allowed to enter
            temples, they instead created their own places of worship with illustrations of the Mother Goddess
            (Mata) on pieces
            of cloth.

            Devipujaks are landless labourers. Their main livelihood comes from stone-cutting work or selling
            cattle, goats,
            vegetables and datan-twig toothbrushes. Their main deities are Meldi Mata, Kalika Mata, Khodiyar Maa
            and Bahuc.

            The Vaghris also believe in animal sacrifice for various rites where the consumption of meat and
            alcohol seems to be
            culturally accepted.

            MASAN PAINTING
            You are no doubt aware of the Hindu festival of ‘Masan Pooja’. This is still practiced by the
            Rajbanshi tribe,
            particularly in North Bengal. They believe that Masan Devta exists as a ‘rudra’ god. This might seem
            at odds with
            other Hindu celebrations but it should be done nonetheless.

            That’s why people suffering from this think that ‘Masan Devta’ is responsible. They go to the
            occultists who
            sometimes scare the spirit away, other times drive it away.

            The history of Masan deities is linked to the spread of ancient Buddhist religion of Tibet. They
            were neither
            considered as gods or demons and they were meant for worshipping near crematoriums.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The word ‘masan’ is derived from the word ‘shashan’ in Bengali. An ethnic group-the Rajbonshis are
            the main patrons
            of this art form that they call masaņ chitrakala.

            The early representations of the Masan deities were rendered in silk paintings that resembled
            Tibetan thangkas or
            paintings on cloth. They were said to have healing powers and the Masan paintings were often used
            for treatment.

            Since the closing of the Silk Route in North Bengal, Tantrik Buddhism has lost influence and is now
            limited to
            Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling &amp; Coochbehar.

            There was no tradition of metal work in India before the Mughals. Many centuries ago, a Mughal ruler
            known as Raja
            Man Singh brought skilled artisans with him from Lahore and set them up in Jaipur.

            The Meenakari work in India is a tradition with a long history. The art form originated from
            Rajasthan.
            Subsequently, Meenakari work took roots in India and Jaipur went on to become the hub of Meenakari
            work in the
            country ever since.

            Meenakari is a technique that takes a lot of skill to do. It’s performed with a metal object that’s
            attached to a
            lac stick & then detailed designs are etched or engraved into it. This leads to creating intricate
            pieces of art.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Enamel dust of the desired color is poured along the design and the groove’s heat melts the enamel
            to a liquid form.
            This process is repeated again and again with different colors until a final product is created.

            Generally, white is laid down first and red last. After the final color has been fired it is cooled
            and buffed with
            agate to add depth. The underlying different colors determine how light plays off of the object.

            Both silver and gold are used as a base for Meenakari. Silver work the best with enamel because it’s
            a softer metal.

            Ganjifa is an ancient Indian card game that was popularized during the Mughal era. Ganjifa cards are
            believed to
            have arrived in India through Persia, then widespread across Europe before settling in India.

            Ganjifa used to be called “Ganjifa” in Persian, and that means cards. The word Ganjifa is derived
            from the Persian
            word ‘Ganj’, which refers to money and treasures. It was a common, leisurely practice for the
            aristocrats to involve
            stakes in the game. Mysooru Ganjifa was extensively patronized by the Mysore Royal Family.

            One theory is that the Indian game of Kreeda Patra was renamed Ganjifa when it was brought to other
            parts of the
            world.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            This is because Kreeda Patra is, in fact, an Indian card game. While it has been popularly played in
            the
            Telangana and Andhra regions of India for centuries, it’s only recently gained popularity around.

            However, under the Mughal rule during the 16th-18th century, Kreeda Patra cards became much more
            elaborate and grew
            in popularity. These cards were renamed Ganjifa and ultimately became a royal amusement for this
            period of Persian
            and Arabic influence in India.

            Ganjifa became popular under the rule of Maharaja of Mysore, Mummadi Krishna Raj Wadiyar, and is
            sometimes also
            known as the “Mysore ‘Chada’ Ganjifa” type.

            King Akbar helped to create Ganjifa as a specific board game and to promote its integrity.

            Mysore Painting is a form of classical South Indian painting that evolved in the Mysore city of
            Karnataka. It’s at
            its zenith under the patronage of Wodeyars, Mysore being under their reign.

            The art of the Mysore school reached its peak during the rule of Raja Raja Wodeyar I. The occupation
            of artists
            dispersed after his death though, and the school ceased to exist.

            Mysore paintings are often mistaken for Tanjore paintings, because the colors are very similar at
            first glance.
            However, closer inspection will reveal that Mysore paintings have finer brush work & more delicate
            colors, while
            Tanjore paintings have a rougher, more bold style with broader brush strokes.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            In Mysore paintings, gesso is a low relief, intricate substance that is used in the background of a
            painting. This
            helps to bring out details such as clothes, jewelry and architectural features. Whereas in Tanjore
            school gesso has
            a lot of relief and is typically used for depictions or images that have deeper meanings or symbols
            behind them.

            The process of producing a Mysore painting typically follows a number of steps. The first step
            involves making a

            Mughal Painting, also known as Persian painting, was an art tradition in Persia (modern-day Iran),
            mostly during the
            Mughal Empire. It is often considered a part of the wider Persian miniature tradition, although the
            Indian
            influences are very strong.

            Painters would paint scenes on miniatures which could either be single or multiple scenes. This form
            of art emerged
            from Persian miniature paintings and was used heavily by the Mughal Empire during the 16th century.

            In Mughal painting, patronage from ruling emperors led to a its development as a court art. The art
            began to decline
            when the rulers lost interest. The subjects mainly come from a secular perspective, such as
            illustrations to
            historical texts and Persian & Indian literature, portraits of the emperor and his court, studies of
            natural life,
            and genre paintings.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The school had its beginnings during the reign of Emperor Humayun from 1530-40 and 1555-56. The
            emperor invited two
            Persian artists, Mir Sayyid Ali and Khwaja Abd al-Samad to join him in India. The earliest and most
            important
            undertaking of the school was a series of large miniatures of the Dāstān-e Amīr Ḥamzeh, undertaken
            during the reign
            of Akbar (1556–1605) which, when completed, numbered some 1,400 illustrations of an unusually large
            size. Of the 203
            that have survived, the largest number are the Austrian Museum of Applied Art in Vienna.

            Nirmal Paintings are a popular form of Indian folk art done in Nirmal in Nirmal District, Telangana,
            India. The
            paintings in this gallery are made using only natural colors and the main themes are religious,
            rural scenes, family
            scenes and landscapes.

            Telangana -town of Nirmal is known for its crafts and art. The locals, called Naqash, make beautiful
            handicrafts
            which are sought worldwide. The paintings on Nirmal products capture the rustic ethos to the royal
            environment and
            show beautiful forms in a variety of colours. There are explicit images that capture flora and
            fauna.

            Once upon a time, the Nizam of Hyderabad was welcomed with a grand ceremony in Nirmal. The artisans
            decorated the
            venue and built a throne for the Nizam with an intricately designed banana bud, which they believed
            would not only
            look good but also hold his weight.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            He was bathed in a golden cascade of petals. This led to the Nizam patronizing the artisans,
            impressed by their
            skill. In 1951, Lady Hyder brought a group of artisans to Hyderabad and promoted this craft. This
            was under the
            Cottage Industries division in the Nizam’s government.

            Most of the paintings in Nirmal rely on traditional scenes from the ancient Hindu epics, Ramayana
            and Mahabharata.
            They’ve been influenced by other styles, like Kangra, Ajanta and Mughal miniatures.

            One of the most famous forms of Indian folk art is the Pattachitra. It consists primarily in
            paintings on cloth and
            depicts mostly Hindu divinities. “Patta” means “cloth” and “Chitra” means “painting”

            Pattachitra painting is a traditional Indian folk art of Odisha that’s been around for centuries. It
            was originally
            used for rituals and as mementos to pilgrims. Today, it can be seen on everything from walls to
            boxes of sweets. You
            can find a Pattachitra on almost any surface in Odisha, but some of the most interesting pieces are
            on the pillars
            outside.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Pattachitra, which is an ancient form of Indian folk art, serves as a visual tool during the
            performance of Bengali
            songs.

            The paintings of Odisha can be divided into three broad categories from the point of view of medium,
            i.e. paintings
            on cloth or ‘Patta Chitra’, paintings on walls or ‘Bhitti Chitra’ and palm leaf engravings or “Tala
            Patra Chitra’ or
            “Pothi, Chitra’. 

            The paintings seen in Pattachitra drawing resemble old Odisha’s paintings of famous temples and
            centres of Puri,
            Konark and Bhubaneshwar region, dating back to the 5th century BC.

            Pattachitra painting is done with 4 colors, red, yellow, white & black.

            Patua is an India folk painting that originated in West Bengal. This type of art is traditionally
            drawn on a piece
            of cloth known as a pati (or patta).

            The paintings are stitched onto the scroll, which is strengthened by adding fabric from old saris to
            the back.
            Sometimes, one scroll can have a scene or panel from a longer story painted on it. It could also
            have images of
            animals or scenes that were made up by the artist.

            Patuas, like other traditional painters, began by painting scrolls or patua depicting the mangal
            stories of the gods
            and goddesses.

            For generations, scroll painters or patuas have gone from village to village telling the mangal
            stories of the gods
            and goddesses. People found these scrolls to be a great source of entertainment.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Traditionally, Patua painters used a brush made of bamboo and goat hair. Today, scrolls also depict
            current affairs,
            history, and other subjects apart from the traditional themes. Painters use vegetable dyes with
            vegetable gum fixed
            on paper.

            The Patua are an artisan community found in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, and
            Odisha, as well
            as parts of Bangladesh. Some Patuas are Hindu, while others are Muslim.

            Hindu Patuas are active in the Kalighat and Kumartuli regions of Calcutta, as well as other parts of
            West Bengal.
            Their population is small.

            Pipli Art, Odisha: The city of Pipili, in Puri District, Odisha, India is known for its appliqué
            work–also known as
            chandua or odia cānduā. The word “appliqué” comes from the French language meaning to put on
            something.

            There are two different techniques, appliqué and reverse appliqué, that can be used to construct a
            multilayered
            textile. In appliqué, a luxurious fabric is sewn over the base layer. In reverse appliqué, two
            layers of fabric are
            laid down and then cut out in sections.

            Pipili appliqué work originates from the 12th century, during the time of Lord Jagannath. Earlier,
            Gajapatis
            prepared these as canopies and umbrellas for Ratha Jatra during the day.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            In the 13th century Puri kings employed craftsmen to make offerings to Lord Jagannath. They set up a
            village for
            these people named Pipli. There is a history of people in Assam making clothes for the chariots of
            Lord Jaganath,
            Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra.

            With royal patronage, the appliqué work became the pinnacle of quality. According to temple records,
            Maharaja
            Birakshore of Puri appointed the darji or tailor community to supply appliqué works for the daily
            rites performed in
            his temple. This is one way they make money for themselves. However, the sale of handicrafts is also
            an important
            source of income to them.

            Pichwai paintings also known as “Pichvai” is a traditional Indian Indian folk art having its origins
            in Rajasthan,
            India. It consists of a series of painting on cloth using natural colors and vegetable dyes. The
            paintings are done
            with a natural brush made from animal hair or cotton threads.

            Pichwai (pichvai) is a style of Indian folk art that originated over 400 years ago in the town of
            Nathdwara near
            Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. Intricate & visually stunning, pichwai paintings are made on cloth and
            typically depict
            tales from Lord Krishna’s life.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Pichwai arts are paintings of Lord Shrinath which are usually carried out on fabric in dark, rich
            colours. These
            Indian folk arts have an ancient religious significance and are done by hand with great devotion by
            the artist.

            Most texts under this style revolve around Shrinathji, who is seen as a manifestation of Krishna,
            and the text will
            mention how he held the Govardhan hill on his last finger.

            The Pichwai paintings are a tradition that is practiced by the Hindu Brahmins of India. This
            religious tradition is
            believed to have roots in the Vedic period and is executed with utmost devotion by the artists. The
            paintings can be
            seen as a map to the universe and are used as a way to see how all of these pieces fit together.

            Pithora painting is a widely famous style of traditional Indian folk art from Madhya Pradesh, where
            figures are
            painted on the wall.

            Pithora Painting is an indigenous form of art practiced by the Bhil and Bhilala tribes in Gujarat
            and Panchal
            Plateau. To paint a mural, artists only use white water-based paints and no other decoration.

            Pithora paintings are known for their scenes of harvesting, fertility of land, festivals, childbirth
            etc.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Paintings are often considered sacred in Pithora culture and Baba Pithora is the god who’s
            worshipped to heal
            illness and undo bad omens. A painting has to be created following consultation with a tantric after
            worshipping,
            and this has to be done at the main wall of the house.

            Likhandra was invited to create paintings using khakhra (Butea Monosperma) brush stems. khakhra
            (Butea Monosperma)
            is a species of Butea native to tropical and sub-tropical parts of the Indian Subcontinent and
            Southeast Asia.

            Khakhra (Butea Monosperma) is also used for timber, resin, fodder, medicine, and dye. The wood is
            dirty white and
            soft. Being durable under water, it is used for well-curbs and water scoops. Spoons and ladles made
            of this tree are
            used in various Hindu rituals to pour ghee into the fire.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            Rajasthan is one of the pioneers of miniature paintings in India. This Indian folk art form evolved
            here in
            Marwar-Mewar region as textual illustrations to the Jain text Kalpa-Sutras around the early 15th
            century. 
            This first Indian folk art style began to take form in the Bhagava paintings of Palam (carried out
            around 1555) and
            has been widely used in the art styles of Rajasthan. This style incorporates indigenous art forms as
            well as Western
            influences.

            Rajasthani school of painting was first seen during the end of the 16th century for Mewar. Many
            various painting
            styles developed in Rajasthan over time, though the most famous ones are Kota, Bundi, Bikaner,
            Kishangarh and Mewar.
            At present-day Jaipur.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            They mainly used primary colors (such as red, blue, and yellow) along with green, brown, and white.
            Gold and silver
            were also used in some paintings.

            Two main factors contributed to the development of Rajasthani paintings: first, the patronage of
            rich Rajputana
            communities and second, the revival of Vaishnavism and the growth of bhakti cults.

            There were a variety of themes in Rajasthani Paintings, including seasons (Bhahmasa), Ragamala
            (Rag-Raginis) music,
            hunting, religious themes from the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and love scenes of Radha and Krishna.

            The Indian folk art, Phad Paintings date back to a 700-year-old legacy and they get their name
            because of the way
            they were traditionally rolled or folded. These are created using the scroll technique. The
            paintings depict local
            tales by scrolling up & down, representing both sides of the story. They were carried around by
            priests who would
            sing out the stories to set them in motion.

            The stories of the gods from Rajasthan – mostly Pabuji and Devnarayan – are shown on these ‘phads.

            The Bhopas, folk singers traditionally carry the painted phads along with them and use these as
            mobile temples for
            worship; they’re used by the Rebari community of the region.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The Phads (flags) of Pabuji and Devnarayan are normally about 15 and 30 feet respectively.
            Traditionally the flags
            were painted with vegetable colors.

            Previously, Phad painting was practiced exclusively by the Joshi community. It is understood the
            Phad paintings made
            in Jaipur lacked the vibrancy and aesthetics that was present in the paintings made by Joshi
            families of Bhilwara
            and Shah Pura.

            In 1960, Shree Lal Joshi opened a school called the Joshi Kala Kendra to teach students from various
            castes how to
            paint this art style. The name of the school eventually became Chitrashala.

            Rogan painting is a traditional Indian folk art with textile printing technique, whereby fabric is
            printed with oils
            and vegetable dyes and marked by either blocks (printing) or a stylus (painting). Rogan Art is a 400
            years old
            traditional painting technique that nearly died out before being revived by two families in the same
            village.

            The word Rogan comes from Persian, meaning varnish or oil, a term adopted under the Mughal Empire. A
            tool of many
            uses, this oil based paint is typically applied to fabric to produce a beautiful and durable finish.
            It is
            traditionally used by the Muslim community in Kutch – a province of India. The name ‘Rogan’ and some
            traditional
            designs may suggest an origin from Iran but there are no historic records available to confirm
            this.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Rogan painting was created in the Kutch region 400 ages ago. The painted fabric was mostly purchased
            by women of the
            lower castes who wanted to decorate clothing and bed coverings for their wedding. Therefore, it was
            a seasonal art,
            with most of the work taking place during the several months when most weddings take place. In the
            ‘off season’, you
            would have artisans doing other kinds of work, such as farming.

            In the late 20th century, cheaper machine-made textiles made Rogan painting an occupation that is
            more expensive.

            Reverse glass painting is a centuries-old folk art form that was created in Italy and then spread
            across Europe in
            the 16th century. Reverse glass painting was first introduced to China’s market by western Catholic
            missionaries in
            16th and 17th century.

            It quickly became popular among the nouveau riche who wanted to maintain an outward appearance of
            wealth & success,
            but on a budget. By 18th century, the Reverse glass painting craze had spread to India’s west coast
            where many
            Indians are willing to spend.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The adoption of colour glass art was associated with symbolic and cultural figures and occurrences
            as early as 5th
            century.

            There are three types of glass paintings

            Stained glass work is a type of art in which colourful glass is used to make decorative windows and
            other objects
            which let light pass through. It can be lovely for people to look at. Europeans used to stain the
            already cut and
            shaped glasses in metallic salts. They would then trace the drawing and paint the composition on the
            stained glass.
            Reverse glass painting is an art form that is painted from the reverse side of the glass.<br>
            The paints for these
            paintings are made by grinding and mixing the pigments with binders such as gum or resin. Then the
            paint is applied
            to the front of the glass in reverse order and the unpainted areas are coated with mercury,
            providing a mirror
            background to the colored images.

            Eastern India has some beautiful roots in folk art, represented through the Saura tribe’s wall
            painting tradition.
            Particularly evident in regions like Orissa. The Saura people’s paintings are also called ikons.
            These pictures were
            traditionally painted on their houses, but now they are well known all over India..

            Saura art is a really interesting way to see how the Sauras lived and what they believe. They’re a
            tribe from the
            state of Orissa, but they’re really dynamic and colourful. With a history that has been mentioned in
            the Ramayana
            and the Mahabharata, the Sauras are known for their distinct tribal culture and their art.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Another interesting facet of the Kerinci people is their deep connection to nature. Their family art
            reflects this
            and seems to be a simplistic depiction of village life. The Saura people rely on their art and the
            symbolism within
            it to hold on to their customs and culture.

            For the Saura tribe, who do not have a written language, their artwork is often used as a record of
            history,
            philosophy and other cultural beliefs.

            Saura art is traditionally made on the red or brown clay walls of the homes of the villagers, with
            natural dyes made
            from rice, white stone, and flower and leaf extracts, using a brush that is made from tender bamboo.

            The Indian folk art, Sanjhi has been around since ancient times and required a lot of patience,
            skill and precision.
            It was traditionally used to create intricate Krishna-themed Rangoli patterns at temples.

            Based on mythology, Radha, Krishna’s beloved lady-love used to hang on to her freshly plastered cow
            dung walls by
            using colored stones, metal foils and flowers, to draw Krishna’s attention.

            Seeing Radha do this, other Gopi’s in Vrindavan began painting walls with Sanjhi art to attract
            Krishna. ‘Sanjhi’ is
            derived from words like “Sajja”, “Shringar” and “Sajavat” which all mean decoration.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Sanjhi is a traditional Indian art form with many intricate designs and delicate patterns. Designs
            are often based
            on legendary Hindu tales of gods.

            Designers will often cut a stencil out in a shape of what they want to create and use it in a
            repetitive fashion in
            order to create their wanted image. They do this with the help of small custom scissors.

            The Rangolis were made using colours, flowers or stones. Some craftsmen also practiced Sanjhi during
            the Mughal era,
            but in entirely different themes.

            Earlier, artisans would use rough paper or banana leaves to make stencils, but in contemporary times
            handmade and
            recycled papers are also used.

            In the city of Hazaribagh in Jharkhand, India, an indigenous Indian folk art form called Sohrai Art
            is practiced by
            the women. It’s a ritualistic art done on mud walls to welcome the harvest and to celebrate cattle.

            The Sohrai art form is popular in 10,000-4,000 BC and decorating walls with murals of this kind was
            common in caves.
            In the last few centuries, the paintings have been hung on mud walls.

            They created the paintings on two occasions: one time after it had rained and before the harvest.
            The other was
            during weddings.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            They make a layer of mud on the wall, and while it is still wet they use their fingertips to create
            various designs.
            These generally include fruits and flowers as well as other illustrations of nature.

            The dark outline on the walls is visible because of the white mud that was applied on top and it’s
            not a part of the
            design. This is how artists from Sohrai show their spontaneity in terms of drawing different
            patterns on the wall,
            without much planning.

            Some artists focus on designing their canvases to be between 12-18ft wide. These designs are almost
            always based off
            the artist’s memory and personal experience. The artwork reflects an interest in nature and human
            interactions with
            it.

            The Surpur style of Indian folk art that is considered as an offshoot of the Vijayanagara style. The
            art flourished
            under the patronage of rulers for about two centuries, particularly during the reign of Immadi
            Venkatapa Nayaka and
            Mummadi Venkatapa Nayaka.

            The present day Surpur style paintings owe their origin to the murals found in the walls of ruined
            mansions and
            temples of Surpur taluk in Yadgir district.

            The style is similar to the more established Mysore (now Mysuru) and Tanjore styles of painting in
            terms of the
            gesso work and the rendering of gold leaf with embedded semi-precious stones.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Surpur miniature art, recognized as one of the finest miniature art forms in the world, is facing
            extinction due to
            lack of institutional support and training to budding artists by seniors to keep this beautiful art
            form alive. The
            thematic content adheres to mythology and Vedic themes such as the ashtadikpalas or the guardians of
            eight
            directions.

            Colonel Philip Meadows Taylor, an able administrator and an artist, contributed significantly to
            preserving these
            paintings when he served in Surpur as a representative of the Nizam of Hyderabad. He worked in the
            region from 1842
            to 1850. He took many of these works when he returned to England and they are found in the museums
            of England even
            now.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
            Tikuli art is a unique type of Indian folk art from Bihar with a rich history. Literally, the word
            “Tikuli” means
            “bindi” which is what they wear on their forehead usually as decoration.

            The Bindi, traditionally an Indian headpiece worn by women, was originally created to symbolize
            worship of
            intellect. They are still used for religious ceremony but have become more mainstream in recent
            times. The Tikuli
            art style has enabled women artists to be creative and express themselves whilst challenging the
            male-dominated
            industry.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Tikuli art originated 800 years ago in Patna. It deals with beautifully designed paintings which are
            manufactured in
            the local streets of the city. With its popularity, Tikuli art managed to attract more traders to
            buy it in bulk.
            This had catapulted the Mughals to take an interest in it, who appreciated the finer points of this
            art-form.

            As the Mughal Empire began to decline and the British Raj took over, indigenous arts like Tikuli
            faced a sharp
            decline. Industrialization had caused people to abandon the local trade for machine-made options
            that weren’t as
            high quality. Thousands of Tikuli artists were left jobless when machine-made bindi entered the
            market, causing
            Tikuli art to cease production.

            Tussar Painting is a form of Indian folk art that date back to ancient traditions. Some places the
            painting is on
            silk and other places it’s placed on cloth or canvas. Originally, the painting came from Jagannath
            Temple in Puri
            and other locations around India.

            These paintings portray a large variety of themes, from religious and mythical stories to exotic and
            raga (musical)
            narratives.

            Tussar paintings are often thematic and colorful, made with natural dyes. You can often find steep
            borders and
            intricate designs in these artworks. Patta paintings are thought to have begun in 500 B.C. These
            were originally
            drawn on cloth that resembled a scroll, but over time they morphed into Tussar silk sarees.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Pata paintings were traditionally from the patta-chitra temple paintings from Odisha, Eastern India.
            The Tree of
            Life illustrates the most important aspect of human existence – life. It all starts with your
            culture—or in India,
            Kalpabrukhya. This is an adaptation of Rudraksha trees. It’s an analogy for mankind’s most vital
            need for life.

            The whole thing is hand-painted on a natural Tussar silk background. The established colors used for
            paintings are
            brick red and black. The difficult part is to perfect every stroke with the handmade brush that the
            artist has been
            mastering for a long time.

            Thanjavur Paintings are an ancient traditional Indian folk art form and their common theme is
            mythology. They
            demonstrate that spirituality is a necessary component of a creative work. Tanjore Painting is a
            classical South
            Indian art developed in the late 16th century in Thanjavur, also known as Tanjore in Tamil Nadu, a
            south Indian
            state.

            The art of Tanjore originated in the city of Thanjavur, which was originally the capital city of the
            Chola Empire.
            It has taken on its own look, enriched with intricate architectural designs and bright colors after
            being influenced
            by the murals from imperial era. The unique style of Thanjavur or Tanjore painting as known today,
            is known to have
            flourished in the Maratha court of Thanjavur between the 17th and 19th centuries.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The Maratha people of India, who had been practicing painting for centuries, found new ways to
            depict the human body
            and naturalistic landscapes under the guidance of King Serfoji II.
        
            The Mughal era saw many changes in the style of artwork. The Marathas ruled over Thanjavur for
            nearly two centuries,
            and brought a distinctive style change to Thanjavur paintings.

            The paintings consist a well-rounded figure, a deity with almond shaped eyes. The figure would be
            housed in an
            enclosure created by means of an arch, curtains etc.

            Thangka paintings are Tibetan scrolls that are hung on the wall. It is often carried in ceremonial
            processions by
            lamas. Thangka is a Tibetan art form that is unique to the culture. In Tibetan, the word “than”
            means “flat” and the
            suffix “ka” stands for “painting.”

            A thangka is a kind of large painting that can be used as a scroll. When not displayed, it’s rolled
            up. The most
            common shape is an upright rectangular form. The Buddhist libraries are full of beautiful, haunting
            thangkas
            depicting scenes from the Buddha’s life. Despite their extensive history, thangkas are still very
            much alive due to
            their deep connection with Buddhism. Thangkas are paintings that Tibetan practitioners use to help
            them develop a
            close sense of connection with their respective meditational deity.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Thangka paintings are very complicated and require intense preparation. 

            Early Buddhist paintings from India influenced Tibetan Buddhist painting, which evolved from those
            painting
            traditions found in places like the Ajanta Caves and Dunhuang on the Silk Road. Early examples of
            these paintings
            were elaborate on a wall, but later became simpler.

            Thangka painting is practiced in Ladakh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, and Lahaul and Spiti, and Kangra
            districts of
            Himachal Pradesh in India. In Dharamshala, Thangka painting is practiced by Tibetans in exile.

            The Santhal people are an indigenous tribal community in India who live in the states of Jharkhand,
            Bihar, West
            Bengal and Odisha. The paintings are made with locally sourced materials such as rice paste, tree
            bark, cow dung and
            natural pigments.

            Like any other tribe the Santals have an exclusive artistic perception rooted in their cultural
            traditions and
            physical environs.

            Santiniketan is a central center for Indian art and is renowned for being the home of Rabindranath
            Tagore. Tagore
            was interested in the Santhals when he visited Santiniketan’s “Hamlet” close to the school and
            convinced Nandalal
            Basu to teach art in his own personal school.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            The Santhals are known for painting the walls of their huts during their village festival. This
            ceremony, they
            believe, is for ceremonial performances as well as an outlet to express themselves. They worship a
            stone as a
            formless representation of the divine. They sing about the burden of their life and provide an
            interesting portrait
            of their everyday experiences.

            Warli painting from Maharashtra is one of the oldest styles of Indian folk art that’s managed to
            persist for
            thousands of years. Warli paintings are mainly created by Tribal people from North Sahyabadri Range
            in India.

            The Warli tribe is one of the largest in India, located outside of Mumbai. Despite being close to
            one of the largest
            cities in India, The Warli culture is centered on the concept of Mother Nature and elements of
            nature are often
            focal points depicted in Warli painting.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            Many Warli paintings depict the Tarpa dance as a central component. The Tarpa is a kind of
            trumpet-like instrument
            that different men take turns playing. The dancers pair up, intertwining their hands and circling
            the tarpa player.
            They then follow him in a turning and pressing manner; he can’t turn his back to them because they
            will always be
            around him.

            Farmers make up a large proportion of the tribe and provide food for many people. They respect
            wildlife and nature
            because it’s important to their way of life as well as providing them with food.

            Warli artists often use their clay huts as a backdrop for their paintings, as people did with the
            cave paintings
            before them. These basic wall paintings use simple geometric shapes: a circle, triangle and
            square.<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

            These shapes represent different aspects of nature.
