		<h1>52 INCREDIBLE INDIAN FOLK ART FORMS THAT WE MUST PROTECT IN INDIAN ART AND CULTURE: </h1>
		<br>
		<p class="para_1">
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;This article is an attempt to create awareness about 52 of the most incredible pieces of Indian folk art,
			and help revive this beautiful art form and pass it on to the next generation.

			When I started this project some 12 months ago, I identified 10 Indian arts that were slowly disappearing.
			Over the course of time, as I peeled away the layers of research and found more and more arts that need to
			be preserved.

			Indian folk art and craft has many interesting aspects that are not typically discussed. This article
			explores the history of Indian folk art that has survived and evolved over thousands of years to become what
			it is today. Without proper care, this culture could be lost to future generations – so its important to
			preserve it now!

		<h1>The Importance of Understanding Indian Art and Culture</h1>
		<br>
		<p class="para_1" id="demo1">
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; While exploring the history of culture, it is essential to understand the background of each country. India,
			with its rich history and influence on other cultures, has a lot to teach us about culture.

			India is the most populous country in the world, with over 1.4 billion people living in it. It is home to
			some of the most ancient civilizations, and has a long history of cultural richness to boast about.

			While India was a place where many scholars and intellectuals found refuge from colonialism, it also became
			a place where many ideas were exchanged and creative works were created.<br>
India has a long and diverse history. The country has been through many eras and has influenced other
			countries in numerous ways. From Vedic philosophy, to the teachings of Buddha, India has always been at the
			forefront of culture-changing ideas Culture is an important part of any society. It can help or hinder the way a nation creates, develops, and
			progresses. Culture is constantly evolving with time. 

			Cultures and creativity both affect economic, social, and all other aspects of activity. The country of
			India is one of the world’s most culturally diverse countries, as it has been home to a multitude of
			cultures for millennia.

			This diversity in Indian Art and Culture is symbolized by the plurality of its culture. India has one of the
			world’s largest collections of songs, music, dance, theatre, folk traditions, performing arts and rites and
			rituals.

		<h1>What is Indian Folk Art?</h1>
		<br>
		<p class="para_1" id="demo2">
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;In Indian Art and Culture, one of the few forms of entertainment in ancient India was folk arts. Indian folk
			arts are culturally based art forms that are handed down through generations. These traditional art forms
			include music, dancing, puppetry, storytelling, and much more. This is a very unique feature of Indian Art
			and Culture.<br>

	In Indian Art and Culture, the art of storytelling has been around for as long as humans have been telling
			one another stories. It has evolved over time to reflect changes in technology and religion and social
			norms. It is said that storytelling first began with the fire story – where people would gather around a
			fire at night and tell each other stories.<br>

Traditional Indian Folk art is a term that refers to the artwork of people who are not professional artists,
			such as painters or sculptors, and is often created in isolation. In our Indian Art and Culture, the term
			“folk” imply an emphasis on originality and simplicity: no formal qualification is required to produce folk
			art, and the style of work reflects the culture from which it originates.<br>
Folk arts are artistic traditions that originated in a common context and were passed down through
			generations by being taught informally, this is so much the heart of our Indian Art and Culture. They
			include painting, drawing, sculpture, printmaking, blacksmithing, pottery-making, weaving, or other textile
			arts such as quilting-crocheting-knitting; ceremonial object making; decorative object making.<br>
Indian Art and Culture has always been a melting pot of cultures and traditions. It is also one of the few
			places in the world that have preserved centuries-old folk art through its heritage and vibrant culture.

		<h1>Why Do We Need to be Concerned about the Future of Indian Folk Art?</h1>
		<br>
		<p class="para_1">
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;India is home to over 50 traditional folk and tribal arts. These Indian folk arts have been passed down from
			generation to generation for more than 3000 years. However, a large proportion of these traditions are at
			risk of extinction. The once-thriving community of artists is now dwindled down to a couple of families
			fighting to keep the art alive.

			Indian Folk Art is a very important and respected part of Indian culture. It has been preserved and
			perfected by generations of artisans. The art form was created to fulfill the needs of the community, who
			learned to use materials that were readily available to them such as clay, straw, wood, and more.<br>
The pre-modern world was full of colors. This artisan also learned to extract colours from vegetables,
			fruits, flowers and stones. For example, red ochre is made by grinding clay and adding it to animal fat;
			white would be extracted from rice or sea shell, yellow from stone called “hardital” and so on.<br>

			These beautiful works can be seen in temples, homes, walls and even on pottery.

		<h1>The Truth Behind How These Indian Folk Arts are Disappearing</h1>
		<br>
		<p class="para_1" id="demon">
			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;The truth behind how these Indian folk arts are disappearing is complex. There are many different
			contributing factors that have caused the disappearance of these folk arts.

			We can start looking at how westernization has impacted these traditional cultures. Westernization has had a
			negative effect on the cultural identity of these traditional artists, buyers and their beliefs. This has
			led to change in what they made, what was made for them, and how it was made.

		There are also external forces that have contributed to the disappearance of these folk arts including
			colonialism, poverty, technology, globalization, and urbanization.

			The folk arts are being threatened. As the world becomes more globalized, poverty is on the rise and
			technology is becoming more advanced, folk art has slowly disappeared due to the lack of funding and
			interest.<br>

		<h1>What's the Future of the India's Dying Folk Arts? </h1>
		<br>
		<p class="para_1">

			&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;In the past, folk arts were a way for people to express themselves and pass down traditions from generation
			to generation. Nowadays, more and more of these folk arts are dying out as the way of living has evolved and
			adapted around western culture.
Folk arts include all types of folk art such as music, dance, painting and so on. These types of arts have
			been around for many centuries and have been passed down from one generation to the next in some cultures.

			Indian folk art has become a dying art. The lack of awareness about these folk arts among the new
			generations of art collectors, both in India and outside has led to this sad situation where these folk arts
			are slowly disappearing.
Young people are not taking up the profession due to its low earning potential.

			The Cheriyal scrolls of Telangana, the Chittara of Karnataka, the Dhokra of West Bengal, the Kavad of
			Rajasthan, The Leather Puppet of Andra Pradesh and the Rogan of Kutch are all endangered. India’s folk arts
			are all threatened because many traditions don’t make money and people don’t want to do them.<br>

		Folk arts need to be saved for their intrinsic value and not just as a way to make money. For them to
			survive, we need creative ways to keep these traditions alive and relevant by helping those who love the art
			but cannot afford it.

			The Indian folk art is slowly being replaced by western art in our living rooms. While Indian folk art has
			maintained a unique identity, it is steadily losing its relevance in both the domestic and global art
			sphere.
